  * Design consideration: Describe the issues that need to be addressed, introduce the assumptions and constraints of the design, provide high level design view of system.
  * Test plan: Deploy overall testing strategy and criterion for the testing technology. Set up test cases and explain the function of each case.
* __Entrance criteria__: None.
* __Exit criteria__: Use-case model, design approach for app. Design plan and requirements (with supplementary requirements) should be defined with roles.
  * Expected Deliverables:
    * Project Plan
    * Use Case Model/Diagram
    * Design Document
    * Test Plan
    * Additional Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.2 Construction
